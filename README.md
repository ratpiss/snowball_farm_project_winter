Simple program that would aim and shoot a snowball in Project Winter

This script gives you 5 seconds after its start to open the game's window, then it will start aiming for 0.1 seconds, shooting the snowball and repeating that cycle once again. 
Right now I'm figuring out how to stop it after a certain key is being pressed.
