# snowball_farm_project_winter
Simple program that would aim and shoot a snowball in Project Winter

Dependencies: pynput, pyDirectInput, time, threading

This script gives you 5 seconds after its start to open the game's window, then it will aim, shoot the snowball and repeat that cycle once again. 

In order to stop you need to press END button 

# Known issues
[x] For some reason the cycle doesn't work quite as intended: it aims, it shoots, then it aims twice before actually shooting a snowball.

[ ] The camera tilts constantly, so you can't be 100% sure that you will hit your targer after some time.
